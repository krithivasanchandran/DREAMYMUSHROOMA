## What's the platform all about
Privacy safe content sharing social platform - strictly sharing about what's your last night dream is all about. The platform is not to be judged by anyone as all the content posted by the user are shared anonymously in our gallery. Dreams usually don't have logic and are full of images and the persons they have seen. They are short stories which could be conveyed over our platform to comment about their crazy dreams. The anonymous users will be not be able to connect to each other as traditional social sharing platform , but instead comment on on the posts that have been posted by other anonymous users. Personal identifiable information is strictly prohibited from sharing and if they share , we are not deemed responsible for their actions.

We sincerely restrict uploading of images as it will violate the privacy law of the user and strictly remain to text content as the content will be reviewed by our review panel before it is being posted live on to the main stream gallery. You can download the data that you have shared and you could analyse your mood or sentiment of your dream using our google natural processing libraries free of cost. Again we don't store any of the user data, the response could be copy pasted to your local desktop machine or download it as a file.
